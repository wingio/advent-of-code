# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, entirely in Kotlin.

## Prerequisites:
 - Java 17 or higher
 - IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio

## Info
All puzzles can be found in the `src/main/kotlin/puzzles` directory.
Only example inputs are included, real inputs are not pushed in accordance with AOC guidelines.

To run the solution for a given day just click the run button in the main function of that puzzles file.
